Additional Notes :
You can change the colors (of the sun etc.) by modifying the data in the ColorConstants.h file in the Core/Shaders/Include folder

"UNIFORM NOT FOUND" errors can safely be ignored.

define "DO_INDIRECT_CAUSTICS" (or just uncomment the line with the #define) in "Source/Core/Shaders/DiffuseTrace.glsl" to enable indirect caustics (from transparent materials)
