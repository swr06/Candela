Notes : 
- There will be additional helpful tips and shortcuts given in the imgui windows. 


- When in edit/debug mode, click on an entity and then unlock the mouse to Translate, Rotate or Scale (change using function keys F6 -> F9)
- When you click an entity in edit/debug mode, you will also get a new window where you can change various parameters (ex. roughness multiplier or emissivity)
- The FBO Manual debug mode (in edit/debug mode) is used when you want to check the raw pixel values entered. (Do note that I use the simple transform 1-e^(-x) before outputting.
- The frame graph (in edit/debug mode) is interactable and dynamic
